GET /stats:
	responds with this json:
		{
			"current_meal": <...>,
			"scores_total": <...>,
			"num_votes": <...>,
		}

	"current_meal" says what meal Leutner is serving at this time. It is one of:
		"breakfast"
		"brunch"
		"lunch"
		"dinner"
		Or it is null if there isn't a meal currently going on

	"scores_total" is the total of all votes that have been submitted during this meal (not averaged!).
		e.g. if 3 people submit votes of 5, 4, and 9, then "scores_total" = 5 + 4 + 9 = 18

	"num_votes" is how many votes have been submitted during the current meal.
		if 3 people have voted, then "num_votes" = 3.

	The average score for the current meal is "scores_total" divided by "num_votes"

	If "current_meal" is null (i.e. leutner is currently closed), then the "scores_total" and "num_votes" fields will both be null

POST /vote:
	requires this body data (json):
		{
			"score": <whole number between 0-10>
		}

	"score" is the score the user submitted
