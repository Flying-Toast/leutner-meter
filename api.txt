GET /stats:
	responds with this json:
		{
			"currentMeal": <...>,
			"scoresTotal": <...>,
			"numVotes": <...>,
		}

	"currentMeal" says what meal Leutner is serving at this time. It is one of:
		"breakfast"
		"brunch"
		"lunch"
		"dinner"
		Or it is null if there isn't a meal currently going on

	"scoresTotal" is the total of all votes that have been submitted during this meal (not averaged!).
		e.g. if 3 people submit votes of 5, 4, and 9, then "scoresTotal" = 5 + 4 + 9 = 18

	"numVotes" is how many votes have been submitted during the current meal.
		if 3 people have voted, then "numVotes" = 3.

	The average score for the current meal is "scoresTotal" divided by "numVotes"

	If "currentMeal" is null (i.e. leutner is currently closed), then the "scoresTotal" and "numVotes" fields won't be present

POST /vote:
	requires this body data (json):
		{
			"score": <whole number between 0-10>
		}

	"score" is the score the user submitted
